1. Create a React application to display a map. Then using this [Helsinki API](https://open-api.myhelsinki.fi/doc) to get a data about places of interest in Helsinki, and show them on the map as markers. Keep in mind that the data return by the API is huge, so make sure to use pagination.

2. User can add reviews to these places on your map, for example: comments, ratings, etc. The reviews data are stored in a database of your choice and are retrieved by your API. User has to login with google to review

Tech stacks recommendation:

- React
- Redux
- `react-mapbox-gl` for displaying map
- MongoDB or PostgreSQL
- Mongoose or TypeORM
